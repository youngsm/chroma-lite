class BVH(object):
    '''A bounding volume hierarchy for a triangle mesh.

    For the purposes of Chroma, a BVH is a tree with the following properties:

      * Each node consists of an axis-aligned bounding box, a child ID
        number, and a boolean flag indicating whether the node is a
        leaf.  The bounding box is represented as a lower and upper
        bound for each Cartesian axis.

      * All nodes are stored in a 1D array with the root node first.

      * A node with a bounding box that has no surface area (upper and
        lower bounds equal for all axes) is a dummy node that should
        be ignored.  Dummy nodes are used to pad the tree to satisfy
        the fixed degree requirement described below, and have no
        children.

      * If the node is a leaf, then the child ID number refers to the
        ID number of the triangle this node contains.

      * If the node is not a leaf (an "inner" node), then the child ID
        number indicates the offset in the node array of the first
        child.  The other children of this node will be stored
        immediately after the first child.

      * All inner nodes have the same number of children, called the
        "degree" (technically the "out-degree") of the tree.  This
        avoid the requirement to save the degree with the node.

      * For simplicity, we also require nodes at the same depth
        in the tree to be contiguous, and the layers to be in order
        of increasing depth.

      * All nodes satisfy the bounding volume hierarchy constraint:
        their bounding boxes contain the bounding boxes of all their
        children.

    For space reasons, the BVH bounds are internally represented using
    16-bit unsigned fixed point coordinates.  Normally, we would want
    to hide that from you, but we would like to avoid rounding issues
    and high memory usage caused by converting back and forth between
    floating point and fixed point representations.  For similar
    reasons, the node array is stored in a packed record format that
    can be directly mapped to the GPU.  In general, you will not need
    to manipulate the contents of the BVH node array directly.
