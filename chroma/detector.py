class Detector(Geometry):
    '''A Detector is a subclass of Geometry that allows some Solids
    to be marked as photon detectors, which we will suggestively call
    "PMTs."  Each detector is imagined to be connected to an electronics
    channel that records a hit time and charge.

    Each PMT has two integers identifying it: a channel index and a
    channel ID.  When all of the channels in the detector are stored
    in a Numpy array, they will be stored in index order.  Channel
    indices star from zero and have no gaps.  Channel ID numbers are
    arbitrary integers that identify a PMT uniquely in a stable way.
    They are written out to disk when using the Chroma ROOT format,
    and are used when reading events back in to map channels back
    into the correct array index.

    For now, all the PMTs share a single set of time and charge
    distributions.  In the future, this will be generalized to
    allow per-channel distributions.
