Chroma: Ultra-fast Photon Monte Carlo
=====================================

Chroma is a high performance optical photon simulation for particle physics detectors.  It tracks individual photons passing through a triangle-mesh detector geometry, simulating standard physics processes like diffuse and specular reflections, refraction, Rayleigh scattering and absorption.  

With the assistance of a CUDA-enabled GPU, Chroma can propagate 2.5 million photons per second in a detector with 29,000 photomultiplier tubes.  This is 200x faster than the same simulation with GEANT4.

Development
-----------

Chroma is under heavy development.  Tagged releases will happen soon,
but in the meantime we encourage people to obtain the code directly
from the Mercurial repository hosted at Bitbucket:

  http://bitbucket.org/chroma/chroma

For questions, ideas, and discussion, join the Chroma development mailing list:

  http://groups.google.com/group/chroma-sim

For bug reports, please create a Bitbucket account and use the Bitbucket issue tracker:

Documentation
-------------

The core concepts are described in the :download:`Chroma whitepaper
<chroma.pdf>`.

The software documentation is evolving rapidly, so
many of the following sections are incomplete at the moment.

Authors
-------

Chroma is developed by Anthony LaTorre and `Stan Seibert
